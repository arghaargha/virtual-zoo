Belonging to the family Elephantidae, elephants are divided into two species: the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). These remarkable mammals are known for their distinctive trunks, which serve multiple functions such as grasping objects, breathing, and communication.

                Elephants are highly social beings, forming close-knit family groups led by a matriarch in the case of female-dominated herds. Their large, impressive tusks, which are elongated incisor teeth, have unfortunately made them a target for poaching, posing a significant threat to their survival. Elephants play a crucial role in shaping and maintaining their ecosystems, as they contribute to seed dispersal and vegetation control.</p>
